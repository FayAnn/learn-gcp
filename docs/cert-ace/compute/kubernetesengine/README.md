# Kubernetes Engine

## What is a Kubernetes Configuration?
 - Key value store to host environment variables and values
 - ConfigMap are used to parameterize configuration files and keep them generic
 - Sensitive information (e.g. password, credentials) should be stored in secrets and not ConfigMap
