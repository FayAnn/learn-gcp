# Exam preparation

## What is the exam format
 - 50 questions
 - Multi answers
 - Unlike the PCA certification, the Associate Cloud Engineer exam does not test on case studies.

## How to approach the exam question?
 - Read fully the question or context. An answer may be slightly better than the other depending on a soft requirement (e.g. simplest, fastest).
 - Recognize the distractors, most questions have two obviously wrong answers and two reasonable answers.

## Before taking the exam
 - Practice deploying sample workloads in a GCP lab environment
 - Practice deploying using the CLI commands
 - Read the GCP official documentation
 - Take the Associate Cloud Engineer [Practice Exam][https://cloud.google.com/certification/practice-exam/cloud-engineer]
