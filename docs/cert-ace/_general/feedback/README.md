# Exam feedback

## Overall sentiment
 - slightly harder than PCA, but not so much because of subjects, but because way more low-level technical details (CLI details)
 - About same level of difficulty of AWS SysOps
 - Some emphasis on high-level design and planning but the bulk of the exam was on detail-oriented knowledge of deployment (Lots of CLI, some console) and troubleshooting.

## Question categories
 - Questions by perceived difficulty
   - ~5/10 basic questions which are easy if you know the service (e.g. which service to use for transactional database)
   - ~10 questions on high-level technical information
   - ~30 questions on low-level technical details (CLI syntax)
 - I marked 13 questions for review for which I was not sure of the answer

## Topics covered
 - ~20 Kubernetes (deployment, docker image deployment, NodePort Load Balancing)
 - ~10 App Engine (Deployment, split traffic)
 - ~10 IAM (roles, service accounts)
 - ~5 SDK (Configurations, Enable APIs)

## Topics not covered in my studies
 - Unusual gcloud parameters
